Basic system requirements are:
  - Matlab R2014b or later with ScatNet (v 0.2) toolbox. Scatnet toolbox can be downloaded from http://www.di.ens.fr/data/software/scatnet/download/
  - R version 3.3.2 (2016-10-31) or later with package HDclassif (v 2.0.2)

To run the analysis you need to switch between two software environments. For preprocessing, detection and characterisation of ROIs, and visualisation you need to use a Matlab console. For the clustering step, you need to use the R console. Check the step by step instructions document to run a guided analysis (step_by_step_instructions.pdf).
